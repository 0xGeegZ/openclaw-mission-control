# Changesets

Both `apps/*` and `packages/*` in this repo are versioned; add a changeset when you change any of them. CI will block PRs that touch those paths without at least one changeset file and will comment on the PR with the result.

This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)
