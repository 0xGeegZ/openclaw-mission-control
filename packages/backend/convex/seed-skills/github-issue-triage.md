# GitHub Issue Triage

## Purpose

Sort, clarify, and prioritize incoming issues so the backlog stays actionable.

## When to Use

- New issues without clear reproduction steps
- Issues missing expected/actual behavior
- Backlog items that need prioritization or labels

## Triage Checklist

1. **Confirm scope**
   - What area of the product is affected?
   - Is this a bug, enhancement, or question?
2. **Reproduction**
   - Are steps provided and complete?
   - If missing, request exact steps and environment info.
3. **Impact**
   - How severe is the issue (user impact, frequency)?
   - Is there a workaround?
4. **Priority**
   - Assign priority based on impact and urgency.
5. **Next action**
   - Assign owner, add labels, or request more info.

## Output Format

- **Summary:** 1–2 sentences of the core issue
- **Repro status:** confirmed / unclear / missing
- **Priority:** P0 / P1 / P2 / P3
- **Next step:** assign, label, or request info
