# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Report it privately:
   - **Preferred:** Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/0xGeegZ/openclaw-mission-control/security/advisories/new) for this repository (when published), or
   - Send a private message to the maintainers (e.g. via the repository’s “People” or “About” links if contact details are listed).
3. Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and impact if possible.
4. Allow a reasonable time for a response before any public disclosure.

We will respond as soon as we can. We do **not** guarantee any particular response time or that every report will result in a code change.

## Scope

This policy applies to the **OpenClaw Mission Control** codebase in this repository. Third-party services (Convex, Clerk, OpenClaw, hosting providers, etc.) and how you deploy or configure them are outside this project’s scope.

## No warranty or liability

This project is open source software. It is provided **“as is”** without warranty of any kind. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the full disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability. By contributing or using this software, you agree that the authors and contributors are not liable for any damages arising from its use or from reported or unreported vulnerabilities.

## Security updates

We do not commit to a fixed schedule for security patches. When we publish fixes, we will do so via normal releases and may mention security in release notes or a security advisory when appropriate.
