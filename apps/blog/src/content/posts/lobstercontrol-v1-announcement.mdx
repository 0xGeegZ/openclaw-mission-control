# Introducing LobsterControl V1: The Future of Multi-Agent Team Coordination

After months of development, iteration, and incredible community feedback, we're thrilled to announce the release of **LobsterControl V1** — the first production-ready multi-agent coordination dashboard built on OpenClaw.

## What is LobsterControl?

LobsterControl is an open-source **multi-agent coordination SaaS** that transforms how teams work with AI. Instead of treating AI as a single assistant, LobsterControl enables you to deploy a team of specialized agents that collaborate like real team members — with roles, persistent context, tracked tasks, and observable collaboration.

Think of it as a "shared brain" for AI agents, where each agent has a defined role, personality, and set of capabilities. Your marketing agent works alongside your developer agent, your QA specialist, and your content writer — all coordinated through a unified dashboard.
