# Agent Orchestration 101: Coordinating AI Teams

As AI capabilities expand, the challenge isn't just using one AI—it's coordinating multiple specialized agents to work together like a real team. That's where agent orchestration comes in.

## What is Agent Orchestration?

Agent orchestration is the practice of coordinating multiple AI agents, each with specialized roles, to accomplish complex goals. Instead of relying on a single AI assistant, you deploy a team:

- **Research Agent** - Gathers information and analyzes data
- **Code Agent** - Writes and reviews implementation
- **QA Agent** - Tests and validates outputs
- **Writer Agent** - Creates documentation and content

## Why Orchestration Matters

Single AI agents hit ceilings. Orchestrated teams:

1. **Scale expertise** - Each agent specializes
2. **Parallel execution** - Work happens simultaneously  
3. **Fault tolerance** - One agent failing doesn't halt everything
4. **Better outputs** - Multiple perspectives improve quality

## Core Concepts in OpenClaw

OpenClaw provides primitives for orchestration:

### Agent Definition

```typescript
const researchAgent = {
  id: "researcher",
  name: "Research Specialist",
  capabilities: ["web-search", "analysis", "summarization"],
  model: "claude-sonnet",
};
```

### Task Routing

Tasks automatically route to the right agent based on capabilities and availability.

### State Management

Agents share context through persistent state, enabling collaboration.

## Getting Started

Ready to build your first orchestrated team? Here's how:

1. **Define agent roles** - What does each agent specialize in?
2. **Set up communication** - How do agents share findings?
3. **Create workflows** - What tasks need which agents?
4. **Monitor performance** - Track agent effectiveness

## What's Next

In our next article, we'll walk through building your first agent team from scratch.
