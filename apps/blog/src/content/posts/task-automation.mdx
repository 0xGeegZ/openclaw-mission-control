# Task Automation with OpenClaw

Repetitive tasks drain productivity. OpenClaw lets you build self-driving workflows that handle routine work automatically—so your team focuses on what matters.

## What is Task Automation?

Task automation in OpenClaw means creating workflows that execute without manual intervention. Your agent team:

- Responds to triggers automatically
- Processes work through defined steps
- Notifies stakeholders when complete
- Handles errors gracefully

## Automation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Event-Triggered

Something happens → workflow starts:

```typescript
const issueWorkflow = {
  trigger: { type: "github.issue.created", repo: "owner/repo" },
  steps: [
    { agent: "triage", input: "{{ issue }}" },
    { agent: "assign", input: "{{ triage.output }}" },
  ],
};
```

### Pattern 2: Scheduled

Time-based execution:

```typescript
const dailyReportWorkflow = {
  schedule: "0 9 * * *", // 9 AM daily
  steps: [
    { agent: "collect-metrics", input: "{{ yesterday }}" },
    { agent: "generate-report", input: "{{ metrics }}" },
    { agent: "send-notification", input: "{{ report }}" },
  ],
};
```

### Pattern 3: Conditional

Decision-based routing:

```typescript
const reviewWorkflow = {
  steps: [
    { agent: "analyze", input: "{{ pr }}" },
    {
      agent: "route",
      input: "{{ analysis }}",
      condition: {
        if: "{{ analysis.risk == 'high' }}",
        then: [{ agent: "security-review" }],
        else: [{ agent: "quick-approve" }],
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Real-World Example: PR Review Pipeline

Here's an automated code review system:

```typescript
const prReviewPipeline = {
  name: "Automated PR Review",
  trigger: { type: "github.pr.opened" },
  steps: [
    {
      agent: "lint",
      input: "{{ pr.diff }}",
      timeout: "5m",
    },
    {
      agent: "test",
      input: "{{ pr.changes }}",
      timeout: "10m",
    },
    {
      agent: "security-scan",
      input: "{{ pr.dependencies }}",
      timeout: "5m",
    },
    {
      agent: "summarize",
      input: "{{ lint.output, test.output, security.output }}",
    },
  ],
  onComplete: {
    action: "github.pr.comment",
    input: "{{ summarize.output }}",
  },
};
```

## Building Self-Healing Workflows

Automation fails sometimes. Build resilience:

```typescript
const resilientWorkflow = {
  steps: [
    {
      agent: "primary",
      retry: { attempts: 3, backoff: "exponential" },
      fallback: {
        agent: "secondary",
        retry: { attempts: 2 },
      },
    },
  ],
  onFailure: {
    notify: "oncall-team",
    log: "incident-created",
  },
};
```

## Measuring Automation Success

Track these metrics:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Automation Rate** | % of tasks handled automatically |
| **Cycle Time** | How fast workflows complete |
| **Error Rate** | How often retries/fallbacks trigger |
| **Cost Savings** | Time saved × hourly rate |

## Getting Started

1. **Identify repetitive tasks** - Look for manual work that follows patterns
2. **Map the workflow** - Document each step and decision point
3. **Start simple** - Automate one step, then expand
4. **Add monitoring** - Know when things break
5. **Iterate** - Improve based on real usage
