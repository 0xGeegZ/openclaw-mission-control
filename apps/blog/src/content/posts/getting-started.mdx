# Getting Started with OpenClaw

Welcome to OpenClaw Mission Control! This guide will help you set up and run your first agent orchestration workflow.

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an open-source agent orchestration platform designed to manage and coordinate multiple AI agents across different tasks. Built on a modular architecture, it provides:

- **Unified Agent Management** — Coordinate agents with different capabilities
- **Task Orchestration** — Define workflows and dependencies between tasks
- **Real-time Monitoring** — Track agent status, logs, and performance
- **Extensible Architecture** — Add custom agents and integrations

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 24.0.0
- npm >= 11.0.0
- Git

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xGeegZ/openclaw-mission-control.git
cd openclaw-mission-control

# Install dependencies using npm workspaces
npm install

# Start development environment
npm run dev
```

This command starts both the web app and the backend Convex development environment.

## Creating Your First Agent

Agents are the core building blocks of OpenClaw. Here's how to create one:

### 1. Define Agent Configuration

```typescript
interface AgentConfig {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  model: string;
}

const myAgent: AgentConfig = {
  id: "my-first-agent",
  name: "Code Reviewer",
  description: "Reviews code and suggests improvements",
  capabilities: ["code-review", "linting", "documentation"],
  model: "claude-opus",
};
```

### 2. Implement Agent Logic

Create an agent handler that processes tasks:

```typescript
async function handleTask(task: Task): Promise<Result> {
  // Process the task using your agent's logic
  const analysis = await analyzeCode(task.input);
  
  return {
    success: true,
    output: analysis,
    metadata: {
      processingTime: Date.now() - task.startTime,
    },
  };
}
```

### 3. Register the Agent

Register your agent with the orchestration system:

```typescript
await registerAgent(myAgent, handleTask);
```

## Building a Simple Workflow

Here's a minimal workflow that chains two agents:

```typescript
const workflow = {
  id: "code-review-workflow",
  steps: [
    {
      agentId: "code-reviewer",
      input: { code: fileContent },
      dependsOn: [],
    },
    {
      agentId: "documentation-generator",
      input: { review: "{{ steps[0].output }}" },
      dependsOn: ["code-reviewer"],
    },
  ],
};

const result = await executeWorkflow(workflow);
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

OpenClaw provides real-time monitoring tools in the web dashboard:

1. **Agent Status** — View connected agents and their health
2. **Task Logs** — Stream logs from running tasks
3. **Performance Metrics** — Track agent performance and throughput
4. **Error Tracking** — Catch and diagnose failures

## Next Steps

## Common Issues

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is already in use:

```bash
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

### Convex Connection Failed

Ensure your `.env` file contains valid Convex credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your-convex-url
```
