# Building Your First Agent Team

In this tutorial, you'll create a working multi-agent team that can collaborate on real tasks. By the end, you'll have a functional agent squad ready to handle development workflows.

## Prerequisites

- OpenClaw Mission Control installed
- Node.js 24+
- Basic understanding of TypeScript

## Step 1: Define Your Agents

Every team needs clear roles. Let's build a mini development squad:

```typescript
// Agent definitions
const agents = [
  {
    id: "planner",
    name: "Project Planner",
    role: "Break down requirements into tasks",
    capabilities: ["analysis", "planning", "task-breakdown"],
  },
  {
    id: "coder",
    name: "Code Agent",
    role: "Write implementation code",
    capabilities: ["coding", "refactoring", "code-review"],
  },
  {
    id: "tester",
    name: "QA Tester",
    role: "Validate functionality",
    capabilities: ["testing", "validation", "bug-detection"],
  },
];
```

## Step 2: Configure Agent SOUL Files

Each agent needs a SOUL file defining its personality and capabilities:

```yaml
# planner.soul
name: Project Planner
personality: analytical, methodical, thorough
expertise:
  - Requirements analysis
  - Task decomposition
  - Estimation
communication: structured, detailed
```

## Step 3: Create Workflows

Define how your agents collaborate:

```typescript
const developmentWorkflow = {
  name: "Feature Development",
  steps: [
    {
      agent: "planner",
      input: "{{ requirements }}",
      output: "task-list",
    },
    {
      agent: "coder",
      input: "{{ task-list }}",
      dependsOn: ["planner"],
      output: "implementation",
    },
    {
      agent: "tester", 
      input: "{{ implementation }}",
      dependsOn: ["coder"],
      output: "test-results",
    },
  ],
};
```

## Step 4: Monitor & Iterate

Watch your team in action:

- **Activity Feed** - See what each agent is working on
- **Task Board** - Visualize progress through stages
- **Discussion Threads** - Review agent reasoning

## Example Output

Here's what your dashboard shows when running:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agent Team: Feature Development        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Planner: Requirements analyzed      │
│  → Coder: Writing implementation...     │
│  ○ Tester: Waiting for code             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Start simple** - 2-3 agents is enough to start
2. **Define clear handoffs** - Make it obvious when one agent passes to next
3. **Monitor token usage** - Keep track of costs per agent
4. **Iterate on prompts** - Fine-tune agent instructions
