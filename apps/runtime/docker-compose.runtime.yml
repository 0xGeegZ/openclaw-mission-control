# OpenClaw Mission Control runtime + optional OpenClaw gateway (local dev).
#
# Usage (from repo root):
#   docker compose -f apps/runtime/docker-compose.runtime.yml up --build
#   With OpenClaw gateway:
#   docker compose -f apps/runtime/docker-compose.runtime.yml --profile openclaw up --build
#
# Documentation: See docs/runtime/runtime-docker-compose.md
#
# Network Architecture:
#   - Custom network: runtime_default (isolated from host)
#   - runtime service: Listens on localhost:3000 (health checks, task-status HTTP fallback)
#   - openclaw-gateway service: Listens on localhost:18789, accesses runtime via http://runtime:3000
#   - Both services share /root/clawd volume for workspace and configuration
#   - Firewall rules: All ports bound to 127.0.0.1 (localhost-only); not exposed to external networks in dev
